1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500 
I made a list of all the World cup matches we'll watch on your new widescreen TV.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000 
Our first game is at Bloemfontein, then in Durban, then we go to Cape Town for the semi-final.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000 
If everything goes well and we don't mess up

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000 
...we will face Brazil in the the final at Soccer City, in Johannesburg.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000 
That will be such a wonderful game.  I love those Brazilian drums and all the singing.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000 
My Fuhrer...

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000 
FIFA...

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000 
FIFA thought about it, but decided not to ban the vuvuzela.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500 
So there won't be singing, drums, or cowbells.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500 
Stay.  If you have a vuvuzela.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500 
Kitel

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500 
Yodel

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500 
Kripps

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500 
and Buto.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000 
I'm going to shove them up your ass!

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,000 
Those damn horns are ruining the World Cup.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000 
I just spent five grand on a TV and a surround sound system.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000 
Oh God, the wife will kill me.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500 
It sounds like a swarm of bees in my house.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000 
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.  That's all I can ever hear!

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000 
For 90 minutes.  The entire bloody match!

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000 
I might as well stuff tampons in my ears

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,000 
My Fuhrer, you could mute the TV?

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,000 
Then how the hell will I know what is going on?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000 
Fuhrer, the vuvuzela is a cultural icon in South Africa

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,000 
Cultural icon my ass.  It's a plastic bloody trumpet!

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000 
The World Cup is for EVERYONE!

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000 
That damn horn was only made in 2001

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000 
by a plastics company in Cape Town.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000 
Where is the insult in banning it at World Cup matches?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000 
There are over 300 million people just like me...

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000 
watching in their slippers at home

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500 
suffering through 90 minutes of tuneless droning trumpets.

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,000 
It gives me a bloody fucking headache.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,000 
I just want to enjoy the game.  Is that too much to ask?

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000 
Our boys on the pitch can't hear themselves think

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000 
...or their supporters chanting and singing!

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500 
You all know me.  I'm a reasonable man.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000 
But this is the beautiful game...

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500 
It's for the World.  Only every few years.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000 
Sepp fucking Blatter.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000 
That so called President of FIFA.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000 
Him and the rest of FIFA totally fucked it up.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,500 
I swear I'll just give up following the German Team completely.

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,000 
And I'm stuck with useless five thousand dollar home theater.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000 
Do you know what 30,000 vuvuzelas sounds like...

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000 
when you have a 17 speaker surround sound system?

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000 
Don't worry.  You can use ear plugs.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000 
I may give up football. Take up golf.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000 
It's just unbearable. I can't watch it anymore.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,000 
Mr. Strauss

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000 
and Kripps.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000 
I've had it.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000 
Go upstairs.  Find the packing case for the TV and the surround sound system.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500 
Pack it all up. And don't forget the remote control.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,000 
I'll call the Sony dealer and they can come collect it tomorrow.

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500 
Such a shame.
